<p>To begin with this paper is published recently in Carnegie Mellon University and studies about photo sketching. We present a new dataset of paired images and contour drawings for the study of visual understanding and sketch generation. In this dataset there are 1000 outdoor images and each is paired with 5 human drawings 5000 drawings. The Quick Draw Dataset is a collection of 50 million drawings across 345 categories contributed by players of the game Quick Draw. To begin with this paper is published recently in Carnegie Mellon University and studies about photo sketching. The drawings were captured as timestamped vectors tagged with metadata including what the player was asked to draw. Omar Shammah Inked Organictwist Artwork Abstract Artwork Drawings.</p>

<p>Today I want to examine Photo Sketching in Python with GAN that helps to create such new images. We present a new dataset of paired images and contour drawings for the study of visual understanding and sketch generation. The Sketch dataset contains over 20000 sketches evenly distributed over 250 object categories. In this dataset there are 1000 outdoor images and each is paired with 5 human drawings 5000 drawings. Today I want to examine Photo Sketching in Python with GAN that helps to create such new images. One solution might be creating the dataset just like hand drawn shapes with GAN.
